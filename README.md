# CSE208 | Data Structures and Algorithms 2 

- This is the second part of Data Structures and Algorithms course of CSE, BUET. The course is designed to cover the following topics:
    - Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, SCS etc)
    - Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal's and Prim's Algorithm)
    - Single Source Shortest Path (Djikstra and Bellman-Ford Algorithm)
    - All Pair Shortest Path (DP by Matrix Multiplication and Floyd-Warshall Algorithm)
    - Max Flow (Edmonds Karp Algorithm and FOrd Fulkerson Algorithm)
    - Fibonacci Heap Implementation
    - Red Black Tree Implementation
    - Hash Table
    - Branch and Bound Algorithm (Band Matrix Algorithm)

- You can find the first part of the course in the repository [CSE 204 | DSA I](https://github.com/MdRaihanSobhan/CSE-204---Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-1)
